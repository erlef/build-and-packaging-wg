# August 1

Note: This is was an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.

Attendees:

- Fred Hebert
- Peer Stritzinger
- Tristan Sloughter

Agenda:

- Sovereign tech fund proposal follow-up

Notes:

- We sent the proposal in time, have a full roadmap, and will be awaiting for the results. Project selection should be taking place before Sept 1st, when the projects do kick off.
    - They have received more applications than usual, so this lowers the probability of us getting the funding.
