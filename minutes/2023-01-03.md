Agenda:

Those are the topics that were dicsussed

- Lack of maintainers for ESL OS Packages
- setup-beam is experiencing growing pains
- Gradualizer and Gradient news
- maintainer of https://github.com/Supersonido/rebar_mix

Notes:

- Lack of maintainers for ESL OS Packages
  - syncing on the discussion at https://erlangforums.com/t/anyone-from-erlang-solutions-know-when-well-see-updated-packages/1962/8?u=mononcqc
  - no access given yet, just had meetings with ESL folks
- setup-beam is experiencing growing pains
  - github changed their policies for unauthenticated users such that people often see failures with setup-beam
  - some PRs can help fix this and mitigate hitting the API, more work needed soon
  - The main problem is hitting the pagination API for a repo to get the list of versions
- Gradualizer and Gradient news
  - Gradualizer can now handle polymorphic code, thanks to an experimental constraint solver (`--solve_constraints`) and multi-clause specs now work
  - Gradient is being integrated with ElixirLS to try and match the Gradualizer+ErlangLS experience
    - ElixirLS doesn’t have an external diagnostics API, though, and Dialyzer is integrated quite directly with the server, so some internal rework is probably going to be needed.
- maintainer of https://github.com/Supersonido/rebar_mix
  - we're looking for both a maintainer hand-off or someone to take over fully
  - Supersonido is missing and we need their rationale for some stuff before it gets stripped
  - the project only works in some cases, but not the general one.
