# April 4

Note: This is was an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.

Attendees:

- Fred Hebert
- Bryan Paxton
- Thomas Depierre
- José Valim
- Diego Albarado
- Tristan Sloughter 
- Frank Hauleth
- Kiko Fernandez-Reyes

Agenda:

The following topics were discussed:

- `rebar_mix`
- erlang packages (from ESL)
- Erlang/OTP Markdown initiative

Notes:

- `rebar_mix`
  - Bryan asking if it is even useful; the answer seems to be yes, or if it's not useful right now it may be due to its half-broken state
  - There's a side-discussion about whether it could be possible to use `ex_unit` from Erlang, with tests written directly in Elixir
    - This is not in scope; rebar mix is for dependencies more than top-level tests, and would likely require project plugins instead.
  - Access to the repo is required.
  - Tristan thinks we'll have to fork the source.

- Erlang packages
  - the URL will change to binaries2.erlang-solutions.com for the next launch
  - Diego was struggling with Debian/Ubuntu metadata, which was next on his roadmap
  - The old URL will be supported until June 1st
  - The roadmap is currently undocumented

- Erlang/OTP Markdown initiative
  - The EEP needs a proof of concept, an implementation, and then a conversion of existing doc (this is a one-line roadmap)
  - We had another discussion about the format of choice (MD/CommonMark); Bryan reminds that whatever we pick, there's going to be a need for a custom handler.
  - For the POC the expectation is a pure-erlang parser, though there was a chance that using the commonmark C bindings could make sense
    - discussing writing our own parser brings _another_ discussion on the format
      - djot is suggested, José proposes waiting longer for maturity
    - commonmark is more trustworthy and markdown is a weird format that's difficult to do right, very HTML centric
      - external implementations in other languages tend to be tricky to maintain long term
  - Had a review of how this is supposed to interplay with EEP48 (docs chunk specify a module to use which handles converting into a usable format for exdoc)
    - to fully drop the XML support in Erlang/OTP, exdoc would need to be extended to support manpages
      - José mentions that maybe the foundation could fund it; José and Wojtek could mentor it.

Action items:
- Carryovers:
  - Update WG calendar invites to state the async meeting is ongoing
  - Follow-up with board with state of language interop group
