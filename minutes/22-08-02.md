# August 2

Attendees:

- José Valim
- Fred Hebert

Agenda:

- Rebar3 moving to an umbrella structure for vendoring
- Chocolatey (windows package) updates

Notes:

- Chocolatey
  - Elixir is all setup for it
  - Nobody to publishes the Erlang side
     - not a blocker because the Elixir publishing-side now uses the foundation-provided setup tasks
  - would be nice for Windows users themselves though.
  - Onorio was looking to automate stuff ? 
     - José has no bandwidth to look into it, not urgent
- Rebar3
  - New structure for source artifacts
  - Elixir gets pre-built ones, so no risk of conflicts with Mix
  - Extra rebar3 topics:
     - new windows PR to run with the shell using a NIF, both elixir and rebar3 will need to adjust
        - https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/blob/dc3eca5aaf7b7afd9c6c07adbe21a2d07b8a8670/apps/rebar/src/rebar_prv_shell.erl#L152-L165 can likely do a check for the new prim_tty file (https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/6144/files#diff-95d53032c5586997d69964cec2e629a1cfe8db6becd6cfbf7b1aebda1ae36bf9:~:text=lib/kernel/src/prim_tty.erl)
  - if an app is marked as temporary, is that inherited to children?
  - should load/transient apps be inherited to their deps?
     - we think it shouldn't
  - https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/5811
     - could we cache specific load path?
     - not necessary for rebar3 at this point in time, but could give a decent speed boost on rpi3-4;
