# September 5

Note: This is was an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.
It has been run late, and lasted longer for this reason.

Attendees:

- Fred Hebert
- Bryan Paxton
- Barry Moore
- Peer Stritzinger
- Wojtek Mach
- Tristan Sloughter
- Paulo F. Oliveira
- Benedikt Reinartz

Agenda:

- Nix updates
- Bryan updates
- GRiSP cross-build progress
- Community-maintained OTP builds for MacOS at erlef/otp\_builds
- Proposal to add builds.txt to http://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir

Notes:

- Nix updates
  - Merged Erlang 27.0.1: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/329427
  - None of these are merged but are interesting
    - Cross compilation support: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/222407
    - ELP init: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/332273
    - erlfmt: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/337939
- Bryan updates
  - Currently working on adding `is_closure/1-2` and `is_export/1-2` to ERTS
- GRiSP cross-build progress
  - They are pre-cross building OTP versions to improve the life of users who do not have modified or added C code (NIFs).
  - they compute canonicalized hashes over all C code in all deps for pre-built binaries
  - this is being automated in Github Actions whenever a new OTP version drops
- Community-maintained OTP builds for MacOS at erlef/otp\_builds
  - proposal and prototypes at https://github.com/erlef/build-and-packaging-wg/issues/80
  - concern voiced as there is a risk of placing this under the erlef org: we are *not* like the apache foundation where things go to be funded for ongoing development, and *not* everything under the org is actually funded at all.
    - this is something we have seen with setup-beam
    - Wojtek is also okay keeping the project under Hex as an umbrella
    - We'll still create the repo under erlef, but wanted the concern to be recorded and voiced
  - first PR open: https://github.com/erlef/otp\_builds/pull/1, review and collaborative work to do
- Proposal to add builds.txt to http://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir
  - https://groups.google.com/g/elixir-lang-core/c/Vox7VL9FlF4
  - had some support and discussion
  - _Note: as I (Fred Hebert) was writing these minutes, I noticed in the group thread  that the proposal has since been retracted)
