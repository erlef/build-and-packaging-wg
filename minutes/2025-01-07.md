Notes:

- REUSE work
  - Kiko asked for us to share this PR submitted to the [REUSE](https://reuse.software) tool: https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool/pull/1117
  - this should help make the community compliant with license best practices
- Nix
  - new changes include: Erlang 27 is now default, the addition of Elixir 1.18 (also default)
  - In things to do: Make the Erlang default be less reliant on docs
  - Group participants were satisfied with the progress made
- How's everyone doing?
  - The holiday season was seen as slowing people down on progress, but nevertheless very positive and needed break.
