Notes:

- Erlang Packages Deprecations
  - to be done on June 1st
  - replacing the old site will be the last step
- Language Interop WG status
  - Nobody on the board knew anything. We're considering it dead within the B&P WG.
- Docs project and exdoc extensions to support manpages
  - supporting exdoc in OTP repo implied having to support manpages
  - a discussion revealed that [Kenneth stated the OTP team might be okay with deprecating manpages](https://github.com/erlef/build-and-packaging-wg/pull/65#issuecomment-1530962757)
  - A meeting was to be held to know about the end status of that decision; two days later, Kiko said that we can skip manpage support in exdoc for a migration
  - Markdown seems to be the way to go.

Action Items:

- None.
