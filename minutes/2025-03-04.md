Agenda:

- OTP-28 readiness
- Rebar3 not supporting full Hex version picks about to get tricky
- Nix Update

Notes:

- OTP-28 readiness
  - Rebar3 was okay for OTP-28.rc1
    - The OTP team was working on a change to the way archives are loaded in escripts, which caused clashes with Rebar3's model
    - It was later pointed out that this specific change is postponed to OTP-29
  - All OK on Elixir's side
  - OTP team will want tests for OTP-28.rc2 as well
- Rebar3 not supporting full Hex version picks about to get tricky
  - https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/issues/2364#issuecomment-2671015897
  - Cowboy started relying on version behaviors that Rebar3 does not support well, and a workaround is posted in that issue
  - Rebar3 does its own version support which doesn't handle this; prior attempts were made at [switching to Verl](https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/pull/2785) but none got over the finish line
  - None of the current maintainers have time to dedicate to this, this isn't an ideal situation to be in.
- Nix Update
  - Bunch of OTP updates made for 25, 26, 27
  - Work for OTP-28 is not done yet
  - some issues making `ex_doc` use different versions for OTP-27, PR got stuck
