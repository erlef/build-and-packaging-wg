# March 5

Note: This is was an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.

Attendees:

- Fred Hebert
- Bryan Paxton
- Jos√© Valim
- Lukas Larsson
- Paulo F. Oliveira

Agenda:

- OTP 27 readiness

Notes:

- Anything your groups or tools need to be 27-ready? (OTP 27-rc1)
  - Rebar3: appears to be all-good. There's a warning in there that's patched and will need a new release
  - Elixir mostly good, a few details to iron out
  - `rebar3_hexdoc` has had v0.2.22 released to cover OTP-27
  - erlef/setup-beam is now being tested for OTP 27, it's released and no issues are reported
  - kerl/kerl has been adapted for OTP 27, but it'll only be release when 27 is out (we need to use the latest, from the main branch, until then), the relevant change being it creating the docs for 27 locally (using `ex_doc`)


Action Items:

- None
