# Agenda
## Gradualizer
- type system for Erlang and working on compatibility with Elixir.
- Some issues with Elixir compiler - compiler generates code that is different than Erlang code.
- Radek doing active development
- recent: reduce number of warnings to 9 from dozens to hundreds.
- checker is still missing things
- one specific challenge with Elixir; Macros generate some "strange" code that is difficult for type checker.
- type system will always have more information than the macro system.
- constaint solving is going to be an issue wehn doing inference of types

### Additional notes by Radek
- Gradient: Victor Rodrigues (Apple, formerly ESL) contributing a feature to ignore specific warnings esl/gradient#120
- Gradient: Przemek Wojtasik (ESL Kraków) is working on the ability to skip checks on generated code esl/gradient#102
- Gradient: Radek (ESL Kraków) enabled manual type annotations so they’re on par with Gradualizer (they were half-done for the demo, now they’re fully functional) esl/gradient#101
- Gradualizer: Radek made an effort to clean up as many errors as possible in Gradualizer; the remaining errors (9 kinds, some appearing more than once) are either caused by bugs or by limitations of the type checker josefs/Gradualizer#427 josefs/Gradualizer#428
  - by “bugs in the type checker” here I mean that there’s implemented functionality that should type check a given construct, but the implementation is faulty
  - by “limitations in the type checker” here I mean that there’s no logic to check a particular construct or language feature in the type checker
- comparison of Gradualizer with ETC (described in Bidirectional typing for Erlang by Nithin Vadukkumchery Rajendrakumar and Annette Bieniusa):
  - https://gist.github.com/erszcz/4d43a77464c87a514e71eecf2811af63
  - Gradualizer gathers type constraints when it traverses the AST and does other checks, but it doesn’t yet have a constraint solver, so it doesn’t detect some polymorphism-related errors
  - ETC does have a constraint solver, so it can detect some specific errors Gradualizer doesn’t
  - ETC does not cover of a lot of Erlang constructs and therefore fails on should_pass Gradualizer tests - it’s not fit for purpose of real-world use
