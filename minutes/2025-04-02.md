# April 2

Note: This is was an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.
Also note that I mistakenly ran this meeting one day late, which may explain why nobody was around

Notes:

- OTP-28.rc2 readiness
