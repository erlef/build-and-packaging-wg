# November 5

Note: This is was an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.

Attendees:

- Fred Hebert
- Barry Moore
- Adam Lindberg
- Peer Stritzinger
- Justin Wood
- Wojtek Mach


Agenda:

- Nix
- Rebar3 Updates or lack thereof
- otp\_build is stable

Notes:

- Nix updates
  - Erlang LS updated to 1.1.0
  - ELP updated to 2024-07-16
  - cross-compile support [not touched in a while](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/222407#issuecomment-2333953557), has issues with OTP-27
- Rebar3 updates or lack thereof
  - Fred has little time to OSS aside from triaging issues, so few updates happened
  - On the state of Rebar3:
   - there's a few weird bugs that Fred doesn't realistically know how to tackle (eg. global config and cache paths, inability to change profiles of deps' builds and conditional overrides then)
   - would be nice to work on the "include in Erlang" roadmap
  - On the roadmap to OTP inclusion:
   - Was written for a sovereign tech fund proposal
   - Peer suggests shaping up a kickstarter to operationalize the roadmap
   - Fred and Peer to follow-up later on this.
- otp\_build is stable
  - [see the update](https://github.com/erlef/build-and-packaging-wg/issues/80#issuecomment-2459164467), everything seems needed for a v1
  - [Elixir is now using it as an install method](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#install-scripts)
  - Is there an intent to use the repo for all OSes and architectures?
    - while not a plan, there is also no intended blocker to doing this.
    - self-contained builds are the objective
    - next steps would be supporting linux, which is tricky because not all linux builds run on all distros (at least those for glibc or musl); if not feasible, prioritizing ubuntu or centos (a later note says this might have been meant to be fedora?) would make sense
   - to maintain the build it would probably need a MAINTAINERS file with people signing up for it
  - Why CSV instead of JSON?
    - just carrying content from [hex.pm ubuntu builds](https://builds.hex.pm/builds/otp/amd64/ubuntu-24.04/builds.txt) by adding commas
