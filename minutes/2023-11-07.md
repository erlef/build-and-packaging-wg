# November 7


Note: This is was an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.

Attendees:

- Fred Hebert
- Bryan Paxton
- Thomas Depierre
- Wojtek Mach
- Tristan Sloughter
- Peer Stritzinger
- Lukas Larsson
- Adam Lindbergh

Agenda:

- Fred and Rebar3 Maintainership
- Single File Releases
- systools improvements (late thread)

Notes:

- Fred and Rebar3 Maintainership
  - Fred mentions that while he still plans to be maintainer, he has cut back his time dedicated to OSS work for work/life balance.
    - Still uses Erlang for side projects, which he allocates a bit more time to ("scratch my own itches")
  - Most work now seems to be related to more critical features (compilation bugs, major version compatibility) and reviewing all incoming PRs and issues
    - small bugfixes and maintenance will be less likely to happen
  - A question asked was "how do we fill the gap?", which is an issue with a growing portion of the tech industry lately
    - the PHP foundation model was named ("paying for contracts and bounties"), but the core Erlang contributors are not as often freelancers, so it doesn't translate well
      - under the current model for the foundation, you need someone who works 4 days a week so they can work 5 days a week with an extra day from the EEF for a while
      - the EEF doesn't have enough money to tackle full-time stuff
    - No good answers but to be a bit concerned.
- Single File Releases
  - There are 3 categories for these:
    1. CLI tools
    2. Production deployments (Ã  la Golang)
    3. Embedded systems (eg. helping for memory constraints or slow file storage or filesystems)
  - CLI tools are a big interest, but production deployments are a bit less urgent given current containerization patterns
    - static builds are also a really good thing there, even within containers and non-single-file releases to ensure ease of use/deployments
  - hot code loading is likely to be a major problem for something like that
    - maybe opt-in disk loading would be possible
  - The OTP team has been toying with this idea; the model making most sense to them is a bit more like a Java .jar file (you have an ERTS with stdlib+kernel, and then a release to plug with them)
    - this may be a transition step toward single-file releases maybe?
  - [cosmopolitan](https://justine.lol/cosmo3/) was mentioned but nobody mentioned having experience with it.
- systools improvements
  - Tristan has availability to work on some old notes he had found about it and may want funding
  - Changes include:
    - `make_tar`
     - line 1982, fix check that erts bin is a directory, `dirp`, to actually matter
     - add `relocatable` option to `systools:make_tar` that moves `dyn_erl` to `erl`
     - need to get rid of all modifications to erts by relx
     - function `create_RELEASES` in `release_handler` should be able to have libs relative to root
    - `systools`
     - `exref` should be able to ignore apps not in the list to check
     - tarball created by `var_tar` not being created in `out_dir` like it should
     - add functionality for non-code path search for applications
     - includes adding data structure to represent application
  - Bryan encouraged to submit the stipend demand, Tristan to figure out the timing to work properly.
