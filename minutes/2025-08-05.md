# August 5

Note: This is was an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.

Attendees:

- Fred Hebert
- Barry Moore

Agenda:

- Rebar3 had breakage on Windows

Notes:

- Rebar3 had breakage on Windows
  - The main thing that broke for us was related to two lines:
     1. `erlang:system_info(system_architecture)` stopped reporting "win32" and now does "windows" so we had to change some sub-calls to `os:type()`
in places that can't do that switch (eg. Rebar3 hooks) where we needed to update hooks (see https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/pull/2964/files)
     2. This latter one implies that a lot of compile hooks may be broken, but that's due to OSes changing things afaict.
  - nobody else reported breakage (as nobody else was in the discussion)
