Agenda:

- Rebar3 Releases
- Adding OTP 27-rc2 to nixpkgs
- Support for a `deprecated` doc attribute

Notes:

- OTP 27-rc2 General Chat
  - quick discussion around the new strings syntax and `maybe` being on by default
  - tracing sessions looks interesting, but participants haven't had time to try them yet
  - a question was asked wondering if we'd get access to murmurhash3 (which is the internal hash for which no public interface exists)
   - John says there's too much work right now and revamping hashing has been put on hold
  - similarly, [the new regex engine](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/7017) has also been postponed, to OTP 28
- Rebar3 Releases
  - Missing releases were cut for `erlware_commons` and Relx
  - A new rebar3 release was cut accordingly, with a bunch of long-standing fixes.
- Adding OTP 27-rc2 to nixpkgs
  - Barry (first presence in meeting) has managed to make it work
    - there were challenges around `ex_doc` builds
  - the PR was merged later in the month
- Support for a `deprecated` doc attribute
  - Currently the attribute is disjoint, supported by the compiler for OTP-specific deprecations, handled with macros and by `xref` for the rest of uses
  - Making it project-level (so the compiler can warn for any project) is on John's personal to-do list, but it is harder to do than it appears because of in-house build systems
  - José points out that the way it works in Elixir is that compilation is done first, then a pass is done to find deprecations and missing calls
  - EEP-59 doc will look for `-deprecated` attributes and put them in the docs chunk, but you can also do it directly with doc metadata with `-doc(#{ deprecated => ~"Use foo/0 instead" }).`
    - This seems to cover Bryan's needs
  - A suggestion was made about relying on xref (or maybe dialyzer, or both) to warn about deprecated functions. Tools overlap a lot, and xref is fast.
