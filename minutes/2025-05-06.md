# April 2

Note: This is was an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.


Attendees:

- Nobody

Agenda:

- Nothing

Notes:

- Since the WG load (Fred) was on vacation at the time, a scheduled message was instead sent to kick off the meeting. Nobody participated/discussed anything. This is the second meeting in a row where no discussion takes place.
