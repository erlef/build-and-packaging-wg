# May 7

Note: This is was an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.

Attendees:

- N/A

Agenda:

- N/A

Notes:

- I opened the day of discussion on our slack channel as usual. However this month, nobody had anything to discuss and put to the agenda, and so nothing got discussed all day aside from a few reactji.
- April was our busiest meeting in a while, and May is now our least busy meeting ever.
