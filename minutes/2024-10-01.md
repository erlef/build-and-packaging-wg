# October 1

Note: This is was an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.
It has been run late, and lasted longer for this reason.

Attendees:

- Fred Hebert
- Peer Stritzinger

Agenda:

- Ongoing rebar plugin work to support full blown secure remote software update and deployment solution

Notes:

- Ongoing rebar plugin work to support full blown secure remote software update and deployment solution
  - Peer's folks are working on a solution oriented towards A/B tests or blue/green deploys, to be used on GRiSP boards and similar
  - all rebar work and client code to be open source
  - Hot code upgrades are not expected to be part of it. While it might be useful to join them, they aren't in scope at this point.
