Agenda:

Notes:

- How are you?
  - this is our now usual thread of asking participants how they're doing
- Nix
  - More improvements and fixes around updating packages, cross-compilation support, etc.
  - New builds of OTP-26 supported
- Distribution-independent Linux builds of OTP
  - Related to https://github.com/erlef/otp_builds/issues/39
  - distro-independent discussion quickly mentions that one is never supposed to statically link glibc
  - musl issues around memory allocators must be considered
    - not a big deal for Erlang, which uses mmap and its own allocators rather than malloc
    - sigalststack used to cause issues but that appears to be solved
  - openssl also complicates portability
  - might still be useful for CI in general.
