# December 6

Note: This is the first time we attempted an asynchronous meeting over the #build-and-packaging channel over in the EEF slack. These meeting notes are backfilled from the threads we've had there.

Attendees:

- José Valim
- Fred Hebert
- Bryan Paxton
- Thomas Depierre
- John Högberg
- Adam Lindberg
- Wojtek Mach
- Radek Szymczyszyn (late)

Agenda:

Those are the topics that were dicsussed

- Pushing for Markdown or Asciidoc in Erlang, rather than the EDoc syntax
- Feedback request for this meeting format
- Other agenda items that were not picked up by participants:
  - Github action to publish with mix/rebar3_hex
  - Host and maintain Erlang/Elixir/etc packages for apt-get

Notes:
- Markdown/Asciidoc in Erlang
  - This requires a buy-in from the OTP team
  - Related to https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0059
  - Long discussion around which format to prefer (Markdown vs. Asciidoc vs. Others)
    - Markdown is friendlier, and more limited; Asciidoc is what the OTP team prefers right now, informally.
    - Asciidoc supports attributes and macros and more formats that would provide proper compatibility with existing EDoc features
    - Thomas mentioned [Djot](https://djot.net/) which has more features than Markdown but has a similar syntax at the basic level and is a sort of compromise for friendliness
    - Radek mentioned Python using reST vel RST which seems to have decent publishing and asciidoc conversion support
  - if EEP 59 lands it should be easy enough to create eg rebar3_asciidoc plugin using off the shelf asciidoc from hex if one exists and that would add a ton of value to the community already.
    - maintainers could pick any format they want, though the read-side and integration with other tools (eg. the help functionality in the shell or a pretty-printer) would need to be supplied as well
    - There are two doc data paths under the EEP:
      - `[source format <whatever> → [some engine] → HTML/PDF/ebook/etc.`
      - `[source format <whatever> → [some engine] → beam doc chunks <whatever> → display in shells <whatever>`
      - This can be shortened to `source -> maybe preprocessor -> docs chunks -> maybe post processor -> HTML/SHELL/PDF/EBOOK`
    - We had a bit of a discussion about whether the beam chunks would need a unified mimetype or not, or bringing attributes such as `-docformat` for experimentation
    - Risks are a balance of fragmentation vs. the ability to experiment and evolve tools without doing a massive lift-and-shift of every doc at once
    
- A poll was taken about whether there should be an EEP about this with the following questions and results:
  1. **Start with an EEP (i.e., get buy in before work ensues) (5 votes: José, Fred, Bryan, John, Adam)**
  2. Start with an experimental project that implements the work ahead of the EEP (0 votes)
  3. Do both at once (one person handles eep, another person gets going on the implementation) (0 votes)
     
- Feedback on the meeting format (async, thread-based, day long):
  - it can work quite well
  - the meeting can run longer
  - people who haven't been able to attend in a long while could show up; helps accessibility

Action items:
- None specifically
